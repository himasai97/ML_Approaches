    "# Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in machine learning, which greatly impacts the performance of a model. It refers to the process of choosing the most relevant features in the data to give to our model. The Genetic Algorithm (GA), a heuristic approach, has a great advantage for efficient feature selection by providing close to optimum feature subset within a reasonable amount of time. It is a stochastic method for function optimization inspired by evolution by natural selection, where organisms' genes evolve over generations to better adapt to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms operate on a population of chromosomes to produce better estimates. In each generation, individuals are selected based on their fitness scores in the problem domain. They are then recombined to create a new population using operators borrowed from natural genetics like cross-over and mutation. \n",

    "For each individual in a population, a fitness value is assigned. The most used method for fitness assignment is the rank-based method where a higher rank is assigned to the individual that performs better. Thus, it dependens on the relative performance rather than the individual score value. In this approach, the performance of each chromosome is first evaluated and the scores are stored in an array. Individuals are then selected based on how high their score is in the array.\n",
